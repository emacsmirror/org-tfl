Transport for London meets Emacs Orgmode

This is an experimental project to use the `Transport for London (TfL) API <https://api-portal.tfl.gov.uk/docs>`_ in combination with Emacs orgmode.

The plan is to be able to schedule journeys and get information about
stops, delays, departure and arrival time etc.
